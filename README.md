# Robotic 2WD Car, based on Raspberry Pi, Arduino, RaspiCam, L298N, BNO055, batteries and a car kit with 2 DC Motors.
## This project is based on the course "Your First Robot with ROS" from robotignite Academy, but has some adjustments because I'm using diferent materials and the ROS library rossbots has some issues.
